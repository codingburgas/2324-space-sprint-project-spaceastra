Our project's purpose is to visualise 2-D Objects with gravitational force , which can provide a platform to model and visualize the gravitational interactions between various objects in a simulated space. The User has the freedom to choose whether they like to do inside it.

The development of our Project is to educate and revise people from the programm we have made by using formulas and understanding the 2 dimensional world from here.
